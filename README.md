Gated Domain Units (GDU) aim to make your deep learning models robust against distribution shifts when applied in the real-world. To make the GDus simpla and easily applicable, we integrated our GDU in a modular layer. Hence, our GDUs can be applied to your deep learning models by simply replacing the task-specific head of your model with our layer. For example, you can use a pre-trained ResNet-50 as the feature extractor and instead of a classification head you attach our layer that performs the same classification task: <code>model.add(DGLayer())</code>.For the **PyTorch** implementation please click [here](https://github.com/im-ethz/gdu4dg-pytorch).

## Want to learn more about **GDUs**? ðŸ¤“

In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12444), we postulate that real-world distributions are composed of elementary distributions that remain invariant across different domains. We call this the **invariant elementary distribution (I.E.D.)** assumption. This invariance thus enables knowledge transfer to unseen domains. To exploit this assumption in domain generalization (DG), we developed a modular neural network layer (the DGLayer) that consists of **Gated Domain Units (GDUs)**. Because our layer is trained with backpropagation, it can be easily integrated into existing deep learning frameworks (see our example below).

## Introducing Gated Domain Units

Before we introduce our Gated Domain Units (GDUs), we will briefly present our theoretical idea **invariant elementary distribution (I.E.D.)** assumption from a practical point of view. 

### What are invariant elementary distributions?

We postulate the elementary domain bases are the invariant subspaces that allow us to generalize to unseen domains (see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12444) for details). Consider the practical case of classifying the outcome of virus infections based on electronic health records collected from multiple sources such as patients, cohorts, and medical centers. Naturally, several factors determining the trajectory such as gender, pre-existing diseases, and virus mutations can change simultaneously across these sources. While, to a certain degree, these common factors remain invariant across individuals, the contribution of each of these factors may differ between individuals. In terms of the assumptions made in our work, we model each of these factors with a corresponding elementary distribution $\mathbb{P}_{i}$. For a previously unseen individual we can then determine the coefficients $\alpha_i^s$ and therewith quantify the contribution of each factor.

### How do we eploit the idea of elementary distributions in practice?

To exploit this I.E.D. assumption, we developed the Gatd Domain Units. Each GDU learns an embedding of an individual elementary domain that allows us to encode the domain similarities during the training. During inference, the GDUs compute similarities between an observation and each of the corresponding elementary distributions which are then used to form a weighted ensemble of learning machines (see Figure 1).
